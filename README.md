# fabric-wealth
Widget coding challenge for Fabric Wealth

The goal for this project is to showcase my back end and front end skills as it relates to web development. My personal goal is to show a little of both sides of the house, while primarily focusing on the back end functionality. I want to put my own personal spin on this assignment and see what comes out of it.
